            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to build the absolute best end-to-end appraisal and payment processing experience. You are our people. We want you to be successful in what you do, so we build integrated technology to help you process more orders without expanding your teams.</p>

            <h3>The Real Cost of Appraisal Management</h3>
            <p>After 16 years of building and operating one of the nation's leading AMCs, we've seen firsthand what appraisal management really costs organizations:</p>
            <p><strong>Multiple Systems:</strong> Juggling separate platforms for ordering, payment processing, reporting, and compliance creates inefficiency and errors.</p>
            <p><strong>Manual Billing Processes:</strong> Spreadsheet invoices, check reconciliation, and payment tracking consume significant time and resources - often costing organizations over $70,000 annually in operational overhead.</p>
            <p><strong>Complex Appraiser Management:</strong> Vetting credentials, managing compliance, and matching orders to qualified appraisers takes expertise and constant oversight.</p>

            <h3>Why Appraisal Desk Exists</h3>
